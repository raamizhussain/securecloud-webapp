Here is a professional analysis of the security incident:

---

**1. WHAT HAPPENED**
At 2025-12-12 18:14:32, user `user1` attempted to change settings from IP address `192.168.1.40`. This action failed because invalid credentials were provided, preventing the settings modification from completing.

**2. WHY IT'S SUSPICIOUS**
While a single failed attempt due to invalid credentials can be a user error, it also represents an unauthorized attempt to access or modify an account. The slightly negative anomaly score, though small, indicates a deviation from expected normal behavior, suggesting it's worth noting, even if the explicit "Severity: LOW" mitigates immediate alarm.

**3. THREAT LEVEL**
**LOW**. Justification: This is a single, failed attempt primarily due to invalid credentials, suggesting either a user typo or a very early-stage attempt at unauthorized access that was successfully blocked by security controls. The explicit "Severity: LOW" and minimal anomaly score support this rating.

**4. RECOMMENDED ACTIONS**
*   **Notify User:** Inform `user1` of the failed attempt to ensure they were the one attempting the change and to rule out potential account compromise awareness.
*   **Review User Activity:** Check recent login attempts and other activities for `user1` to identify any patterns of unusual behavior or additional failed attempts.
*   **Monitor Account:** Implement enhanced monitoring for `user1`'s account for the next 24-48 hours for any further suspicious actions or failed authentications.
*   **Validate IP:** Confirm `192.168.1.40` is a known or expected IP address for `user1` at the time of the incident.

**5. CONFIDENCE LEVEL**
90%
