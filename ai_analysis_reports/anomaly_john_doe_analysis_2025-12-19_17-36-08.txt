**Security Incident Analysis: Failed File Access**

**1. WHAT HAPPENED**
At 18:46:03 on December 12, 2025, user `john_doe` attempted to access a file from IP address `192.168.1.26`. This attempt failed due to invalid credentials provided by the user.

**2. WHY IT'S SUSPICIOUS**
While a single failed login could be a user error, failed access attempts, especially with "invalid credentials," can indicate an unauthorized individual attempting to gain access to resources. This could be a brute-force attempt, credential stuffing, or an internal user trying to access unauthorized files, even though the anomaly score is only slightly negative.

**3. THREAT LEVEL**
**LOW**
Justification: The incident involves a single failed attempt, which did not result in unauthorized access. The provided severity is explicitly "LOW," and the anomaly score, while negative, isn't significantly low enough to suggest a highly sophisticated or persistent attack from this single event.

**4. RECOMMENDED ACTIONS**
*   **Review `john_doe`'s activity logs:** Check for a pattern of multiple failed access attempts, especially around the same time or from different IPs.
*   **Verify user identity:** If `john_doe` frequently accesses files from this IP, confirm with the user if they were attempting access at that time.
*   **Investigate source IP `192.168.1.26`:** Determine if this IP is internal, external, or associated with a known user/device.
*   **Review lockout policies:** Ensure account lockout policies are effectively configured on the file server or directory service to prevent brute-force attacks.
*   **Monitor for similar events:** Set up alerts for multiple failed file access attempts for the same user or from the same IP address within a short timeframe.

**5. CONFIDENCE LEVEL**
95%
