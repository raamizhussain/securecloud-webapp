AI SECURITY INCIDENT ANALYSIS REPORT

**Incident Analysis**

**1. WHAT HAPPENED**
An administrative user (admin) attempted to upload a file from IP address 192.168.1.42 at 20:18:38 on 2025-12-12. This file upload action failed because the provided credentials were invalid.

**2. WHY IT'S SUSPICIOUS**
While the action itself failed, any attempt to access resources, especially by an "admin" account, with invalid credentials warrants investigation. This could indicate a legitimate user error, but also a potential reconnaissance attempt, a brute-force attack, or an internal user attempting unauthorized access using incorrect credentials.

**3. THREAT LEVEL**
**LOW**
Justification: The action was unsuccessful due to authentication failure, preventing any potential compromise. The incident's pre-calculated severity is low, and the anomaly score is very close to zero, indicating minimal statistical deviation from normal behavior.

**4. RECOMMENDED ACTIONS**
*   **Verify User Activity:** Contact the "admin" user to confirm if they initiated this file upload attempt and understand why invalid credentials were used.
*   **Review Authentication Logs:** Examine surrounding authentication logs for the "admin" account and from IP 192.168.1.42 for any further failed or successful login attempts.
*   **Check Source IP:** Confirm if 192.168.1.42 is an expected internal IP address for this user or service.
*   **Enforce Strong Authentication:** Ensure multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled for all administrative accounts to mitigate brute-force risks.
*   **User Training:** Remind users about secure credential management and the importance of reporting unexpected login issues.

**5. CONFIDENCE LEVEL**
95%
