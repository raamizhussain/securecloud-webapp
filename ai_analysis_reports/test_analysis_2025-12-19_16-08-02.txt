**Security Incident Analysis Report**

**1. WHAT HAPPENED**
A user account, `acc3`, experienced multiple failed login attempts on 2025-12-19 at 14:00:00 from IP address 127.0.0.1. The system recorded five consecutive invalid password attempts, which subsequently led to the account being automatically locked.

**2. WHY IT'S SUSPICIOUS**
This sequence of rapid, failed login attempts culminating in an account lockout is highly indicative of an automated brute-force or credential stuffing attack targeting the `acc3` account. The assigned anomaly score of -0.65 (indicating high suspicion) and the system's explicit severity rating of HIGH further underscore the seriousness of this event.

**3. THREAT LEVEL**
**HIGH**
This incident is rated HIGH because it represents a direct attempt to compromise a user account, potentially leading to unauthorized access. The lockout mechanism prevented immediate access, but the intent to breach security is clear, and repeated attacks could succeed without proper intervention.

**4. RECOMMENDED ACTIONS**
*   **Immediately Force Password Reset for `acc3`:** This will mitigate any potential success from further credential stuffing or brute-force attempts.
*   **Contact and Verify `acc3`'s Identity:** Reach out to the legitimate user `acc3` via an alternative, secure channel to confirm if they initiated the login attempts and to guide them through the password reset process.
*   **Investigate Source IP (127.0.0.1):** Determine if this is a legitimate internal machine, a misconfigured log reporting localhost for an external source, or an indicator of an internal system being used maliciously or compromised.
*   **Review Adjacent Logs and User Activity:** Examine logs for `acc3` (both before and after the incident) and for other accounts during the same timeframe for similar suspicious activity or successful logins from unusual locations.
*   **Enhance Account Security:** If not already in place, recommend enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for `acc3` and other critical accounts, and review overall password policy strength.

**5. CONFIDENCE LEVEL**
95%
